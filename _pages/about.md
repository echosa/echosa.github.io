I have been programming since I learned BASIC back in grade school on an Apple ][e. I currently work for <a href="https://www.bamboohr.com/">BambooHR</a> as a PHP senior software engineer. I also enjoy dabbling in other languages, like Lisp, Ruby, and most programming languages, really. I also enjoy using text editors such as acme, sam, emacs, vim, and, yes, even ed(1)! (Especially ed(1)!). I like dragons and collect them. Tea is ambrosia.
